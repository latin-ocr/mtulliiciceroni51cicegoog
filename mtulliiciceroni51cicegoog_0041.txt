mrv PREFAOE.

I have explained the use of particular words chiefly by refer·
ence to similar usages in the passages here selected, is obvious.
lfa small, part ol Cicero, well learned, is sufficient to lay tbe
foundation of a good knowledge of the Latin language, it is
necessary to show that every particular usage, which is an essen·
tial part of the language, may be explained by lihe examples
drawn from this small part. ”

In selecting matter t'or notes which must be of limited extent,
there is no rule that can be laid down. The object is to help
the render to understand the author, but ome readers require
help, when others do not Where there is a palpable difficulty,
there should be a note. In other cases, the commentator must
be guided by a certain tact and feeling, which, combined with

experience as a teacher, will enable him to make such remarks,
’ and give such hints and suggestions as may be usesul, though
they may nothe all that could be wished.

Of all the pieces in this book the De Amicitia should be read
last, for the reasons stated in the Introduction to that Dialogue.
The first book of Letters is intended for young studente, to
melre them familiar with the ordinary epistolary style of the
Latin language. They should be learned so thoroughly thata
boy should know every formos expression in them. The mutter
will cause little difficulty, the teacher‘s explanation and myfew
notes will be enough sor that purpose. The shorter epistles of
Cicero, those written in a careless manner, as one may say, are
a good introduction to Terence, for they come near to the style
of conversation. The second book os Letters, which contains
longer and more elaborate epistles, is adapted for those who

‚ have made more proficiency. The long epistle to Quintus, being

more in the oratorical style, will serve as an introduction to the
orations os Cicero. The prose language of the Romans should
be learned from Caesar, Terence, and the easier parts os Cicero,
which will furnish ample material for the first few years ofa
student’s course. The reading of other writers and ol Cicero's
Oratione should be deferred till the pupil has mastered the Latin
language well in the purest and simplest form, and where itis
encumbered with few difficulties of matter.
