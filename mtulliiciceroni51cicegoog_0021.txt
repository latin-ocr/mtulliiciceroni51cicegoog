such way that the order of the English words shall correspond
to the Latin, as far as the two idioms will allow, which in· such
simple sentences will generally nothe difficult; hut when this
cannot be done, the teacher must give the meaning of the whole
Latin sentence in good plain English, without regarding the
difference in the order of the words in the two languagea and
he must help the boy in the matter hy fully explaining the
several words and their relation to one another⁸. ll he once
lets the boy begin to arrange the Latin words in anew order,
he has damaged the foundation of his knowledge, he has intro·
duced him to “a wrong placing of words‚” which is justas
injurious in the teaching of Latin, ss if a toacher of French or
any modern language should let his pupils neglect the right
“placing of words.¹’ Two or three sentences at first will ba
enough for a lesson, on which the boys will be examined by tha
master, and will perse every word. But this is not all; every
boy must leam to give the Latin back orally for the English,
and must also write it on paper when the master gives out the
English. Thus he will leam it both ways. All thetheleams
will be true. lle will acquire a great number of words, and a
knowledge of his three concordances. lf the master has done
his duty by interpreting the short sentences arighi, the boy wifl

an'd a right placing of them. So far, if the work is done well, all

is clear gain3 and the boy has got nothing that is riot worth

use of the pronouns and the prepositions. Now it is easy to
select simple sentences, in which the principal uses of the pro·

sider to ho tha right way, itis plain that hc must teach the boy what this
way is; for tho boy knows no way till hohas either been taught one by his
master, or has found out one for himself, which is more likely to he wrong
than right. Tho picking out of tho Latin words and arranging them in
tho English order, cannot be too much condemned. Those who object to
the method here recommended, and would call it taking words in tho
lump, would do well to remember that thero is both awrong and a right
way of taking words in the lump. Thoas who do not know how to' do it

must not qnarrcl with those who do.
