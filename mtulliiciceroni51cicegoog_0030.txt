voi; A voi mi rendo; Vi tendo me, Reudomlvi. All these
expressions bave a different and very distinct meaning ⁴. The
Latinis not capable of so much variety; but in a like sentence
the relative position of ‘tibi’ ‘me‚' and ‘do,' may be varied,
aud must be varied, in order to express like shades of meaning.

1 have already mentioned Mr. Robson’s exercise book, which
isawork of great merit, aud may be used by those who like
myself do not adopt his principle of teaching the elementary
part of the Latin language by writing exercises. The second
edition, besides some other improvements, contains a series oi
Lana reading lessons, well adapted for the use ot' heginners.
ln its present form the work appears to be very well fitted to
serve as an introduction to the reading of a good Latin prose
author; and better than any thing oi the kind that I bava
seen.

Abay who is taught on Mr. Robsou’s method would be
taught well. His direct objectis not to teach ayoung boy to
write Latin, but to give him the knowledge, which he must get
insome way, before he can commence reading aLatin author.
Ferit is agreed among all seusible teachers, that a boy should
read some good Latin author as soon as he cauy Caesar for in-
stance, or parts of Cicero. But it is not agreed which is the
easiest and surest method oi giving a boy the knowledge which
isnecessary to enable him to read. I believe the be'st method

. isaot by writing Latin exercises only, even if the exercises are

l

⁵ the best that can be made: and the reasons for this opinion,

such as they are, may be collected t'rom various parts of this
preface; to which Ι could add others, if the object were to
write a dissertation. To make the writing of Latin, especially
ior young boys, a direct object, is oue oi the gross absurdities
oi modern teachiug, only exceeded by the grossness oi the ma·
uriel, which is produced and called Latin prose. As I have ex·
plained, I would make a boy learn his Latin author both ways,
from Latin into English, and from English into Latin, in order
that he may know both sides of it. ln this way he will acquire
sconsiderable facility ot' rendering English into Latin, without
thruring a sacility in writing bad Latin, which, according to
