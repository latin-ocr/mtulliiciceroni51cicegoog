2 CATO MAJOB.

worhs of his favourite Plato, Aristo of Chios, who had
written on old age, liam Xenophon, and perhaps other
Greek writers. The argument is stated so clearly that
it requires little explanation. The ease and agieeable
manner in which the matter is handled merit the highest
praise; and there are few persons, especially those of
manue years, who have read this treatise once, and would
not wish to read it again. The apology for Old Age, as
it may be called, is a complete argument, for a Roman of
the republican period. Some poor objections have been
urged against it, and a note οι· two is added to meet
some of them.

The notes are short, as they must be in a book of
moderate siae. Nor is there perhaps any advantage in
such copious commentarios as some editions of elassical
authors are encumhered with. Some authors which are
very difficolt, and are read only by ripe scholare, may
bear a heavy weight of notes. 'Phe object of these notes
is to explain the text, as far as they g0; not to explain
every thing. I have used the notes in the Variernm
edition, and the commentary of A. Manutius.

As to the time when 'this treatise was written, see ·
Drumann (Geschichte Rome, vi. 350).

Ihave compared this second edition of the De Senectute
with that of F. V. Otto, Leipzig, 18303 from which I have
¹got a few references, and here and there a little help. 1
have also read the text and the note's in Henricus Alanus
his edition of the De Senectute (Dublin,1852); and 1
have in one or two instances followed his text. Ihave
mser-red to ‘his edition by the letter A.
