men, but doth also discommend¹ and refusa his own former
wout in exercising paraphrasin and metaphrasin. Paraphrasis
isto take some eloquent oration, or some notable common—place
in Latin and express it with other words: metaphrasis is to ,
ake soma notable place out of a good poet, and turn the same
sensa into metra, or into other words in prose. Crassus, or
rather Tully·‚ doth mislike both these ways; because the author
either orator or poet, had chosen out before the fittest words,
and aptest composition for that metten and so he, in secking
other, was driven to use the worse.

“ Quintilian² also preferreth translation before all other exer·
cises; yet having a lust to dissent from Tully (as he doth in
very many places, if a man read his Rhetorick over advisedly;
and that rather of au enricus mind, than of any just cause) doth
greatly commend paraphrasis, crossing spitefully Tully's judg·
urent in refusing the same; and so do Romus, end Tallaeus even
at this day in Franco too. But suoh singularity in dissenting

Tecihrs, nor yet his most excellent learned uncle, the elder

nauy good ways for order in study3 but he beginneth with
translation, and preferreth it before all the rest. And because
liswords be notahle, lwill recita them: ‘Utile in primis, et
