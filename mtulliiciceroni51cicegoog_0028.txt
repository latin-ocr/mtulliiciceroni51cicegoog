pharaon. xxi

gange first. lfa good French master were to teaeh th'e younger
boys French on a proper system for ,a couple of years, they
would speak it with lacilky, write it as well as young boys can
urite a language‚ and be better prepared for the study of Latin.
Aboy who begins Latin at the age of ten, if he hasbeen well
prepared, will be able to understand Caesar in a year, if it is
explained on Ascham's plan.

lt may be said that this system requires better teachers than

sstle great majority of those who profess to teach. But if a
¹, toacher hasnot knowledge enough to teaeh on this plan or some
’ good plan, can he teech on a bad one? Can he teach by the
rid of bad exereise books and indifferent helps ol all descrip· ·
tirus, and in no other way? lf he cannot teacbon Ascham’s
“ plan or on some good plan, he cannot teach at all. If it should
heroid, that this method is more troublesome to the teacher,
rhich I deny, the answer is that he ought to do what he pro·
iesses. · Whether would a man of any sound knowledge, ef any
’ἲ tute sor learning, however· small, rather work at this dull,
,- eumn, unprofitable round of exercises, aids, and helps, or work
, rt the authors themselves, the sole sources of our knowledge?
, On the acore of economy of time and economy of expense much
,night be said. At present a boy is loaded with a heap of:
books, and his parents are saddled with expense for lumber-
, rhich hangs like a load of lead on the boy’s understanding, if '
be has any, and it he has not much, makes him a dunce for life.
llis labour is not about Latin: it is all about books, which ars
about Latin. Agood corrrse of Latin instruction is cheap: it
requires few books. It requires a good master; and those who
would have him must pay him well; for he will dc what he pro·
sesses, and save expense in other ways. The boy shall leave
his master in utter ignorance of the Hermann and Whittingtons
of the day, but well acquainted with Caesar, Cicero, Terence,
0vid, Virgil‚ Horace, and a few other Romans, whom he will be
better pleased to remember than exercise books.

Mr. Wittich, in bis remarks on the teaching of German, insiste
on the great importunae of the pupil reading aloud his exercises,
when they are corrected, and reading aloud the German tales
several times. There is no doubt about the advantage ol this

rvsoem ,· but it will οἰ eoruse only be practisedby more ahuanoeb
