xxx PREFAOE.

“ Ye perceiva how Pliny teacheth, that by this 00000100 01 ·
double translating, islearned easily, sensihly, by little and little,
not only all the hard congruities 01 grammar, the choice 01⁴²
aptest words, the right framing 01 words, and sentences, corne·
liness 01 ligures, and forms fit 100 every matter, and proper 100
every tongue: but that which is greater also, iu· markin'g daily‚
and following diligently thus the steps 01 110 1001 authors, like
invention 01 arguments, like order in disposition, like utterance
in elocuticn is easily gathered up; whereby your scholar shall
be brought not only to like eloquente, 1010100 to all true under·
standing and right judgment, both 100 writing and speaking.
And where Dionysius Halicarnassaeus hath written two excellent
books, the one De Delectu Optimorum Verborum, (the which, Ι
1000, 10 1001,) 110 01100, 01 110 right framing 01 words and sen-
tences, which doth remain yet in Greek, to the great profit 01
011 them that truly study eloquence: yet this way 01 double
translating, shall bring the whole profit asboth 11000 10010100
diligent scholar, and that easily andpleasantly, 101110011010100
01 words, and apt composition 01 sentences.

“ And hy these authorities and reasons am 1 moved 10 think
this way 01 (100110 translating, either only, or chiefly, to 10
fittest 100 the speedy and perfect attaining 01 any tongue.
And for speedy attaining, I durst venture a good wager, 11 0
0010100, 10 whom is aptness, love, diligence, and constancy,
would 101 translate after this sort, one little hook in Tully (as De
Senectute, with two Epistles, the first, Ad Q„ Fratrem, the other,
Ad Lentulum, the last rave one 10 110 first book) that scholar,
1 say, should come to a better knowledge in the latin tongue,
than the most part do, that spend 1000 00 five years in tossing
all 11000100 01 grammar 10 common 0010010. Indeed 1110000
book with these two epistles is not sufficient 10 affcrd all Latin
words (which is not necessary for 0 young scholar to know) but

0100110 10 Pliny, and he suggests 1101 10 trusted to his memory. ’11000 100

curicus (1111000οο010 the first p·rt 01110 passage as quoted by Ascham:

“Utile 10 primis, ut multi praecipiunt, ex Graeco in Latinum at ex Latino

vertere in Graecum.” Pliny certainly does not 10 plain terms recommend

double 1000010110ος 101 0 translation from Latin hy a Roman into Greek

would clearly 10 00 cremisa 01 little use, unless 110 translator had 0 Greek
crrgr'nal to campere 110 translation with.
