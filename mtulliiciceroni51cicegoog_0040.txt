PREFAOE. xxxiii

but those are either rare and peculiar expressions, or words
which have a technical character, and belong to matters of con·
stitutional history, lan, natural history, and the like. Afull
and exact knowledge of all, or even of the greater part of such
words can only be learned by much reading; and even some of
the-primary significatione and nicer ineaniugs of words in
Ι ordinary use can only be acquired by the student when he is
= of riper years. But for a knowledge of the ordinary words of
,- the Latin language‚ their meaning, and the structure of a sen-
tence, a srnall portion of an author is sufficient3 nor can the
Latin language be learned well, unless the foundation is laid iu
some small portion ofa good author or two.. When facility
of reading Latin has been obtained by a proper discipline,
aboy may read as much as the time will allon, and he may
direct bis attention to the matter as well as ιο the language.
But it is a great error to introduce a boy to any author or part
of an author, where the matter is difficult, before he has ac-
quired a considerable facility in tlre language; nor isit any
suswer to this objectioo that he may be helped with notes
and books of reference. Notes cannot in‘any reasonable space '
explain every thiug; and indeed they ought to be chiefly de·
eigued for advanced students and teachers; they should rather·
instruet by suggesting what a learner should look at, than by
sining at complete exposition. As to making a boy use m'auy ”
books of reference, either for matter geographical, historical, or
any other, there is great risk that he shall fall into the habit of
reading about his author or the matter that is in him, instead
of studying the author himself. It is the teacher's business
osupply all necessary explanation for beginners Β; and for this
meson, many notes are not required for young boys. As
dready suggested, whatI have done in these notes, bas been
done with the view of aiding teachers and more advanced
studeuts, rather thau for very young scholare. The reason why

¹1 suppose a teacher to have Forcellini's Lexicon, without which he
mot do much; and some good Latin Grammar. Professor Key's is that
riteh 1 have used. lf a teacher hes also the two Dictionaries edited by
benith, he will find them useful. I make this general reference ιο
llere works here, in order ιο avoid particular references in ths notes aad ιο
tremum.
