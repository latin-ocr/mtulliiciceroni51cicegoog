00101111 teacher may 011 something to Ascham’s method,
slightly modify it; but the principle must remain3 which
this: that the boy shall leam to construet Latin sentences by
00101111 011111 01 them in a Latin author, hythe remarks 011
11100101, and by 111011011011011 01 them in rendering the Englir
back again into Latin. It will be 1100101 0100 when he procee
to subordinate or dependent sentences, as he must do, when 1
comes to read Caesar 01 Cicero, 101 the boy 10 have 0 gos
grammar to refer 10, 10 which some 01 the most important 1111
010 clearly 1011 down, 0101011 0 good exercise book. It
enough 10 remark, that many 01 the grammars in 0111110110
'will not serve this purpose.

The 111010 exact knowledge 01 the Latin tongue is acquired 1
0 00101111 reading 01 the best writers, hy which alone can 1
learned a right choice 01 words, 0 right placing 01 11101111, 0111
right framing 01 0 sentence. How absurd it is 10 expect boys
100111 the right iraming 01 0 Latin sentence hythe ordinat
system 01 exercises, when they can hardly 1101110 0110 111 the
own language correctly. Boys begin Latin very early, and 1
00111 that it is necessary 101 1110111 10 100111 00 11111011 ascanl
learned 01 the language in the way that is nearest to thebe
mode ofleaming 0111010111 language, that 10, hy imitation. 1
they advance 111 years and in understanding under the care 01

good toacher, they begin 10 examine it critically. Itis qui*
possible 101 0 young boy to acquire a considerable facility i
the Latin language‚ before he 10 able to examine the constructio
010 sentence with much nicety. Indeed 11 we consider 11
00111 age 01 which Latin is began, the great waste 01 time an
the hateful nature 01111010110111, on the common system,
would seem to be a better thing 101 him to, 100111 0 11101010 101

³ A singular method 01 teaching the right placing 01 words is used :
Ellis's Latin Exercises, and thus explained iu the preface: “The Secor
Part contains 1110 principa] 111100 01 syntax, with short examples to ther
the Latin words to which correspoud in their arrangement with 11
English3 with an intention that 1110 scholar should, under his master
directim, endeavour gradually to place thern in the Latin order.'' Hc

machis error; and by a. like reason, he must be accustomed 10 any oth
