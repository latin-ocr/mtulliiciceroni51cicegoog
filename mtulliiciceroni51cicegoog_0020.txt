but the memo'ry ol boys is the chief facultyto he used when
they are young, and they will get through this lahour in a
reasonable time. lt is however necessary that a teacher should
avoid the common error of making boys decline nonus with
what are called the signs of the cascs; for if this is done, the
boy will learn something that he will afterwards have to
unlearn; and it is a good principle in teaching‚ that a child
should have no error implanted in him, if we can help it. What
isfirst fixed, whether right or wrong, is very difficult to eradi-
cate. In learning the conjugations also the usual signs or trans-
lations should be avoided, as they lead to erroneous notions,
particularly in the subjunctive mood. The method adopted in
Professor Key'a Grammar, is that ol conjugating the verbs in
connexion with ,some other Latin words, so as to form a short
sentence, of which a translation is given. This method is free
from all objection : the boy learns the meaning of the tenses in
connexion with other words, and at the same time hc begins to
geta small vocabulary.

As to the eight parts of speech, as Ascham calls them, there
is no use in telling a boy the names of a number of things before
he sees them. He cannot compreheud what a proposition is till
he sees it used. When he learns the forms of nouus, adjectives,
and verbs, he will also learn their names, and he may defer
learning the names of the other parts of speech till he meets with
them.

The next thing to learn according to Ascham, is “ the right
joining together of substantives with adjectives, the noun with
the verb, the relative with the antecedent,'’ or the three con-
cordances, as he calls them. There is only one way of learning
this, which is by examples from Latin authors; and a teacher
may iind plenty of the simplest sentences in the best Latin
authors which will serve this purposel.¹ Isay, “in the best
Latin authors ;’' for l would not have the master melre them him-
self. He may select sor this purpose as many as he shall thinlr
fit, which he must translate to the boy, and he must fully
explain every word. He must also translate the sentences in
