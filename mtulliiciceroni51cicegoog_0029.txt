studente, who are bent upon learning. Boys will do very little
that they are not required to do. Still it will be a very useful

exercise to require the boys, when they have thoroughly mas-
tered a Latin lesson, tc read over the Latin aloud and with proper
emphasis, so that the master may judge whether they fully
understand thelasson as they read it. Indeed it is not too
, much to require of boys, who have gone once through the first
book of Caesar's Gallie War‚ tc commit to memory ten ora
dozcn chapters, so as to be able to deliver them orally without
any fault. Such a practice, combined with the remarks of the
master on the order of the words in the daily lessons, will form
⁴ the ear os the boy to a right order, and lay the foundation of a
sound knowledge of the form osa sentence. However much
boys may fail, under the usual system, in the right construction
osa sentence and the ordering cf words, it is certain that they
may attain a greatflproficiency in both by this practice, simply
by the exereise of the ear3 and they may become tolerably
expert in this part of the language before they have attained a
correspondent skill in the right choice of words, at least of any
other than the ordinary words. For the perfect choise of right
words only comes with riper years and much careful reading; as
any man may convince himself by a little consideration. The
proper choice of words to denote abstract terms and terms of
art is learned slowly and with much labour. In factitis the
part oi a language which is learned last.
1f we consider the power which the Latin language has in
varying the order of words in a sentence, so as to express by the
same words, differently placed, different sbades of meaning, we
must admit that the order of the words is as much a matter of
careful observation from the first, as any thing else. What
would be thought ot'a German teacber who should not from the
first make bis pupil observe tbe differenee between the English
and the German order? Or we may take another example from
the Italian language, which has retained all the force and vigour
oi the Latin, and acquired powers unknown sven to the parent
tongue. Biagioli in his Italian Grammar has given agocd
example of an expression which ean be varied seven different
ways, each of which has a different meaning. It is this:
