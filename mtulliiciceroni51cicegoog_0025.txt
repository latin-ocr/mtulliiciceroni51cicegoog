” in this manner, the boy will be able to read it over again witb-

out the previous explanation ot' the master, and with a little
help while he is saying the lesso'n. Nor must the master chide
him, if he is diligent and does his best, even if he fail sometimes.
“If your scholar,'' says Ascham, “ do miss sometimes, cbide not
hastily, sor that shall both dull his wit and discourage his
diligence; but monish him gently, which shall make him both
willing to amend and glad to go forward in love and hope oi
learning. I have now wished twice or thrice this gentle nature
' to be in a schoolmaster. And that 1 have done so, neither by

· chance nor without some reason, 1 will now declara at large, why

in mine opinion, love is fitter than sear, gentleness better than
basnag, to bring up a child rightly in leaming.” And sobe
goes on to argue in favour of gentleness in teaching, and to dis-
course against harsh chiding and besting, premising however,
as 1 would do, to prevent mistake, that “I do gladly agree with
all good schoolmasters in these points: to have children brought
to good perfectness in learning, to all honesty iu manners3 to
have all faults rightly amended3 to have every vice severely
corrected: but sor the order and way that leadeth rightly to
these points we somewhat differ.” (Ascham.)

lt is the fashion in this country for boys to write Latin verses
at a very early age, to which, if the method be well conducted,
there is not the same objection as there is to their writing Latin
prose. The third book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, if well learned,
will teach the boy the structure osa Latin hexameter, and will
give him a fair stock of words. The practice of repeating the
same aloud will form his ear to the verse, so that if the master
shall select easy hexameter lines out of Ovid, plainly turned into
English, and now and then supply a word, a boy will easily
restore the original hexameter, which generally is and always
should be nothing more than a simple proposition with some

² No method is so efficient towards mastering a language aa to commit to
mcmory passages from good authors. Cicero's recommendation was founded
on his own practice: “ Exercenda cat etiam memoria ediscendis adverbum
quam plurimis et nostris scriptis et alienis.” Cicero, De Orat. i. 34.
