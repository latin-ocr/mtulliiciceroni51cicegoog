exercises and the tales in the manner which the author reeom-
mends‚ is able to write and spcalr the German language, and to
read an easy author. The method requires perseverance, regu·
larity, and some time; but if it is followed as Mr. Wittich
directs‚ any boy of ordinary capacity will bave acquired that
command over the German lauguage which very few possess.
1 do not believe that any system of writiug Latin exercises now
in use would produce a similar result3 and yet it is easier to
learn to write Latin, as well as a modern ean learu to write it,
than tolearn to write German ⁸.

Latin might be learned in the same way, if a teacher had as
great command over it, as a German has over his own language;
but this is impossible, and some other way must be attempted
A teacher‘s knowledge of Latin is founded on a few Latin
authors, and his own judgment is no authority; he umst always
appeal to his originals. lt is therefore necessary that the Latin
langnage must be learned from Latin authors, who furnish the
matteras the language both for the teacher and the learner.
The direct object is not to learn to write Latin ; it is to be able
to read the authors with ease; and the means of accomplishing
this must be some method that shall uattain the object, and at
the same time be a good discipline for the learner. A good
discipline has not only the advantage of being good as a disci·
plina, but it will secure the object which we have in view. A
bad discipline will generally fail altogether3 and those who
learn in spite of it, throw away much of their time and labour:
they learn much which, as Ascham says, they will afterwards be
glad to unlearu. ,

. Ascham’s method supposes a certain amount of knowledge,

but be does not explain how this is to be acquired. A boy must
in some way master the various forms of declcnsion and conju-
gation. He may do it by committing them to memory and
writiug out examples on paper. This is a dull and tiresome task;

⁶ Mr. Wittich's new method os learning a modern language was first
explained by himself in the Journal of Educatiou, vol. ir. p. 209. His
methodis further explained in his “German for Begiuners3 or, Progressive
Exercises in the German Langnage,'' third edition, Londou, 1845, and in
his “German Tales,'' Londou, 1845. Mr. Wittich published a Key tc his
Ermuises, aad also a German Grammar.
