PREFACE.

*n——u-

“Asrnn the child hath learned perfectly the eight parts of
speech, let him then leam the right joining together of substan· ,
rives with adjectives, the noun with the verb, the relative with
the antecedent. And in learning farther his syntaxis, by mine
advice, he shall not use the common order in common schools,

¹. for making of Latinos: whereby the child commonly learneth,

Ι first, an evil choice of words¹ (and right choice of words, saith

p Caesar, is the foundation of eloquence); then a wrong placing
of words3 and, lastly, an ill framing of the sentence, with a
perverse jndgment, both of words and sentences. These faults,
taking once root in youth, be never, or hardly plucked away in
nge. Moreover, there is no one thing, that hath more, either
dulled the wits, or taken away the will of children from learning,
than the care they have to satisfy their masters in making of
Latines.

“,For the scholar is commonly beat for the making, when the
master were more worthy to be beat for the meriding, or rather
marring of the same; the master many times being as ignorant
as the child, what to say properly and fitly to the matter.

“Two schoolmasters have set forth in print, either of them a
book of such kind of Latines2, Hermen and Whittington. A

¹ Cicero, Brutus, c. 72, where it is said of Caesar-“ qni etiam in maxi-
mis occupationibus quum sd to ipsum (inquit, in me intuens) de ratione ⁸
loquendi accuratissime scripserit, primoque in libro dixerit verborum
delectum originem esse eloquentiae,'' dec. Compare Suetonius, Caesar, 56.

¹ 1 have formerly seen Mr. Horman’s book, who was master ot Eton
school 'l'he book itself could be of no great use, t'or, as 1 rememben ’twas
only a collection ot single sentences, without order or methoh, put 'mur
lasne (Uptou'snote.)
