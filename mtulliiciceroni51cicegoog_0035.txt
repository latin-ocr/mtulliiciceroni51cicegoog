xxviii PEEEAOE.

Antony Deny’n, in Cheston. John Whitney, a young gentleman,
was my bedfellow: who willing by good nature, and provehed
by mine advice, began to leam the Latin tongue after the order
declared in this bools. We began after Christmas; Ι read unto
him Tully de Amicitia, which he did every day twice translate,
out 01 Latin into English, and out 01 English into Latin again.
About St. Laurence Tide alter, to prove how he pro'iited, Ι did
chuse out Torquatus' talk de Amicitia, in the latter end 01 the

. first bools De Finibua; because that place was the same in
matter, like in words and phrases, nigh to tha form and fashion
01 sentences, as he had learned befo‘re in De Amicitia. I did
translate it myself into plain English, and gave it him to turn
into Latin3 which he did so choicely‚ ao orderly, so without any

, great miss in the hardest points 01 grammar, that some in seven
years in grammar schools, yea, and some in the University too,
cannot do half so well. This worthy young gentleman, to my
greatest grief, to tha great lamentation 01 that whole house, and
specially to that most noble lady, now Queen Elizabeth herself,

specially 01 youth, for the ready and sure obtaining 01 any
ton ue.-—

“gTrinslation is easy in tha beginning for the scholar, and
bringeth also much learning and great judgment to the master.
Itis most common, and most commendable 01 all other exercises
lor youth: most common, for all your constructions in grammar
schools be nothing else but translation: but because they be not

, double translations, (as 1 do require,) they bring forth but simple
and single commodity; and because also they lach the daily use
01 writing, which is the only thing that breedeth deep root, both
in the wit, for good understanding, and in the memory, for sure
keeping 01 all that is learned: most commendable also, and that
by the judgment 01 all authors, which intreat 01 these exercises.
Tully, in the person 01 L. Crassus, (whom he maketh his example

01 eloquence and true judgment in learning) doth not only
prurire specrhlly, and chuse this way 01 translation lor a young
