poetical embellishment. There is no objection to this sort of

exercise, when it is at first limited, as it is almost necessarily, to

the forms of simple sentences,

: We now suppose the boy far enough advanced to proceed on

· Ascham’s mcthod, which requires little comment. The master
must “read unto him ” the Latin author: the boy must not be ,
set to leam his lesson by the aid of a dictionary. Ascbam
mentions no dictionary: possibly there was not one at that time,
which was suited to boys: and it would be much better if there
were none at present to put into boys’ hands, when we consider
what they are. A good dictionary is a necessary help, when
the boy has made some progress; and the master wants it too. A ’
bad one, used from the beginning, is an insuperable impediment
to learning.

There are many of Cicero's epistles ιο his different friends,
which are well adopted to the capacity of boys; and Sturrnius
did good service in selecting such sor the capacity of children.
but the teacher must explain the epistles first, as Ascham directs;
or he may take Caesar's Gallio war, but let him at first omit the
speeches. Itis the teacher's business to explain such au author
to the boys: it is not his business to hear how they have mis·
understood it after hard labour with the dictionary. ln old
times the teachers taught; now it is a common practice tolet
boys learn wrong, in order that they may be set right. But
boys keep iu their head more of their own blundering than of
the master’s correction; and so they learn much that they must
afterwards unlearn. Let then the teacher expound the lesson
fully to a boy, leading him to a right choica oi English words,

· and a correct arrangement oi then1,avoiding all transposition ’
of the Latin in translating, and taking it portion by portion, as
it hangs together in the original, a clear, compact, and con-
sistent whole. He will have to saymuch on the several words
for the full explanation of .them; but each integral part oi a
sentence must be translated as a whole; and the difficulty that
aboy may have about the several words and their order must ba
removed by caresul parsing and, explanation. The Latin text
isthe matter which the teacher has ιο work upon: and it is not
thoroughly mastered until the boy can render the Latinium
English, or gira the Latin for the English indiscissus. lx
