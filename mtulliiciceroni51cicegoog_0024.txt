PREFAOE. xvii

getten, and gotten only by imitation: for as ye use to hear, so
yelearn to speak: if ye hear no other, ye speak not yourself;
end whom ye only hear, of them ye only learn.’' That which is
meos a living language is true of a dead one, of “ the Greek
and Latin tongues, the only two learned tongues, which be kept
notin common talk, but in private books.” (Ascham.) A boy
who learns no Latin except good Latin, will know no other.
For this reason we would avoid the use of any rules written in
Latin, many of which contain barbarous expressions3 and
though some of these rules rnuy be well enough in pointel
expression, it is pure waste of time to iill a boy's head with
modern Latin, when there is so much better matter at hand to
fillitwith. -

lt is here urged that a boy should have none but the plainest
sentences, containing the simple proposition, laid belore him, or
tvo such sentences united by a conjunction, until he has
obtained a good stock of words, and has fully mastered all these
simple sentences so as to render the Latin into the English or
the English into the Latin indifferently. Abovc all, let the
teaeher beware of perplexing him with subordinate or dependent
sentences, until this part is fully mastered. The sentences on
which he must be exercised should only eontain the indicative
· mocd; hut there are some sentences which eontain only in-
dicative moods which must be excluded from this part of his
discipline. How long it may take to do what is here proposed,
will depend on the diligence and ability of the master3 but it
vill nothe a work of very long.time; nor so irksome as the
common method.

Ihave elsewhere suggested that when the pupil has got this
necessary knowledge, the master may begin to explain tc him
the third book ol Ovid’s Metamorphoses, which contains little
more than simple propositione. The learning oi this or any
other easy book will supply the hcy with a large stock of words,
the first necessity that he has. The master must explain each
lesson fully to the buy, who will afterwards he examined in it,
and required to give orally or tc write on paperthe Latinior
any word or any phrase in the lesson that the master may give
eut in English; and when the lesson is well understood, the
