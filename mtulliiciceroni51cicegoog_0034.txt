straight, plain, and easy, the scholar is always labouring with
placente, and ever going right on forward with profit. Always
labouring Ι say3 for, or he have construed, parsed, twice trans-
lated over by good advisement, marked out his six points by
skilful judgment, he shall have necessary occasion to read over
every lecture a deren times at the least. Which because he
shall do always iu order, he shall do it always with pleasure.
‘And pleasure sllureth love, love heth lust to labour, labour
always obtaineth his purpose3’ as most truly both Aristotle in
his Rhetoricis, aud Oedipus in Sophocles do teach, saying rb
δὲ ζητούμενον ἁλωτόν. And this oft reading is the very right
following of that good counsel which Pliny doth give tobis
friend Fuscus, saying, ‘ Multum, non multa⁸.’ But to my pur-
pose agam.

‘⁴ When by this diligent, and speedy reading over those fore·
named good boolrs of Tully, Terence, Caesar, and Livy, and by
this second lrind of translating out of yosu English, time shall
breed skill, and use shall bring perfectior: then ye may try, if
γε will, your scholar with 'the third lrind of translation: although ·
the two first ways, by mine opinion, be not only sufficient of
themselves, but also sures, both for the master’s teaching, and
scholar’s learning, thau this third way is, which is thus:

“ Write' you in English some letter, as it were from him to his
father, or to some other friend, naturally, according to the dis-
position of the child3 or some tale, or fable, or plain narration,
according as Aphthonius⁹ beginneth his exercises of learning,
aud let him translate it into Latin again, abiding in such place,
where no other scholar may prompt him. But yet use you

'yourmf such discretiori for choica therein‚ as the matter may he

within the compass, both for words and sentences, of his former
learning and reading. And now take heed, lest your scholar do
not better in some point than you yourself, except ye have been
diligently exercised in these lrinds of translating before.
