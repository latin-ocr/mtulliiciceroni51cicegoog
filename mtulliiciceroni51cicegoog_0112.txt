lhe little that Ι have done, all that I could do within
the limits, may be of some use; and that is all that Ι can
say. After writing my notes I compared them with the
very elaborate commentary of Dr. M. Seyffert, Branden-
burg, 1844, and by the aid of his notes, most of which
are well worth reading, I have been enabled to add some
things, to correct others, and sometimes to modify what I
had written. Seyffert has also printed the text, and given
at the foot the variatione of Madvig and Klotz ; and his
oouimentary contains the opinions of these and other
critice on many difficult passages. His commentary is
written for a particular purpose, as he explains in his
pressae 3 and with such views as the author had in making
it, the notes could hardly he shorter than they are. The
text of the Laelius'in Seyffert's edition is thirty octavo

pngcs3 the commentary is 566 closely-printed pages,

besides an index,
Ihave made more use of Seyffert's notes for this second

edition, and Ι have perhaps explained some parts better.
But Ι see more clearly the difficulties of this treatise, and
Iam certain that no very young students can read it

aith profit·
