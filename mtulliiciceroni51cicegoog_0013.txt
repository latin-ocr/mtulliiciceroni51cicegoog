There is a way touched in the³ first book ef Cicero de Oratore,
which wisely brought into schools, truly taught, and constantly
used, would not only take wholly away this buteherly sear in
making ef Latines, but would also with ease and pleasure, and ,
in short time, ss l know by good experience, work a true choice
and placing of words, a right ordering of sentences, an easy
understanding of the tangue, a readiness to speak, a facility to
’ write, a true judgment both ef his own and ether men's doings,
what tongue soever he doth use.

“The way is this. Alter the three concordances learned, as
1 touched before, let the master read unto him the Epistles of
Cicero, gathered together, and chosen out by Sturmius for the
capacity of children.
. “ First‚ let him teach the child cheerfully and plainly the cause
and matter of the letter3 then, let him construe it into English,
so ost, as the child may easily carry away the understanding
ν of it; lastly‚ perse it over perlectly. This done thus, let the
child, by and by, beth construe and parse it over again; so that
it may appear, that the child doubteth iu nothing that his master
taught him before. After this, the child must take a paper
book, and sitting in some place, where 110 man shall prompt
him, by himself, let him translate into English his former lesson.
Then showing it to his master, let the master take from him his
Latin book, and pausing an hour at the least, then let the child
translate his own English into Latin again in another paper
book. When the child bringeth it turned into Latin, the master
must compare it with Tully's book, and lay them beth together;

⁸ De Oratore, i. 34. “Postea mihi placuit, ecque sum usus adolescens,
nt summorum oratorum Graecas orationes explicarem, quibus lectis hoc
assequebar ut, cum ea quae legerem Graece Latine redderem, non solum
optimis verbis uterer et tarnen usitatis, sed etiam exprimerem quaedam
verba imitando quae nova nostris emeat, dummodo essent idonee.'' Cicero
says nothing of turning back his Latin into Greek, for his object was to
improve his Latin style. The Roman writers improved their tangue chiefly
by translations from the Greek3 and the translation from Latin and Greek
authors has been one of the modes of impres-ing modern languagrs, as
GiIbcrt Bumet remarks in the prefate to his translation citiores Utopia
