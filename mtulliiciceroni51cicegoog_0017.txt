that as the matter of an author creates a difficulty, a boy must
be first instructed in those authors or parts of authors, which
present the fewest difficulties for the matter, andare written in
an easy and simple style.

If teachers of Latin knew that language aa well as a good
teacher of French or of any other modern tongue knows his own
language, the teaching of Latin would be comparatively easy.
And yet the usual methods of teaching a medem language are
bad, and the amount that is learned is often small for the time
audlabour, and this, mainly because teachers of foreign lan·
guages follow nearly the same methods that are followed in
teaching Latin, many of which are bad. A man may wish to learn
a foreign language in order to be'able to wn'te it and speak it;

’ but if he follow no other method than reading, he will never
accomplish his object. If he will first acquire the power of
writing arrd speaking a language, he can easily leam to read it.
The power of reading or translating a foreign language does not
give the power of writing or speaking it, not even in the smallest
degree, aa all who have tried know byexperienoe. Amen may
have even a very exact knowledge of a foreign tongue for the

’ ,purpose of reading and understanding, and yet may be unable
to construet a single sentence or to utter a single phrase in con·
versation; which proves that to learn to express a foreign lan-
guage in our own tongue is only learning ir under one aspect;

,and that to express our own language or our own ideas in
another tongue is quite a different thing. Indead so different
are the two things, thet a person may learn by ear to speak a
medem language fluently, and yet he may have only aslight
knowledge of it; for the language of common conversation is
very limited. lf he has learned to write the language so aa to
express himself with ease on the ordinary matters of life, as in
oletter or the like, he will have a greater command of the lan-
guage; but even then, hia knowledge will be superficiei without
' acareful atudy of the best writers.

Itis true thet the writing of exercises is one of the meane now
employed for the teaching of modern languages, but the writing
of exercises may be an impediment to learning a language.
The method of the exercises may be aa bad and es ill adopted

to the object, os it would be for a man to learn a iorergntongue
