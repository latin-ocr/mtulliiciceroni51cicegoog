and where the child doth well, either in chusing or true placing
Tully's words, let the master praise him, and say, ‘Here you do
vell.' For, 1 assure you, there is no such whetstone to cherpen
agood wit, and encourage a will to learning, as is praise.

“But if the child m'iss, either in forgetting a word, or in
chauging a good with a worse, or misordering the sentence,
lwould not have the master either frown or· chide with him it
the child have done his diligence, and used no truandship
tberein. ForI know by good experience, that a child shall take
more profit of two faults geutly warued of, than of four things
rightly hit; for then the master shall have good occasion to say
vnto him, ‘ Tully would have used such a word, not this: Tully
would have placed this word here, not there ; would have used
this case, this number, this person, this degree, this gender3 he
would have used this mood, this tense, this simple rather than
this compound; this adverb here, not there3 he would have
ended the sentence with this verb, not with that noun or parti-
ciple‚’ dac.

“In thece few lines Ι have wrapped up the most tedicus part
of grammar, and also the ground of almost all the rules, that are ⁸
so busily taught by the master, and so hardly learnt by the
scholar in all common schools; which after this sor't, the master
shall teach without all error, and the scholar shall leam without
great pain3 the master being led by so sure a guida, and the
scholar being brought into so plain and easy a way. And there.
fore we do not contemn rules, but we gladly teach rules, and·
teach them more plainly, sensibly, and orderly, than they he
commonly taught in common schools. For when the master
shall compare Tully's book with the scbolar’s translation, let the
master at the first lead and teach his scholar to join the aules oi
bis grammar book with the examples of his present lesson, until
the scholar hy himself be able to fetch out of his grammar every
rule for every example; so as the grammar book be eyes in the
scholar’s hand, and also used of him as edictionary.for every
present use. This is a lively and perfect way of teaching of
rules; where the common way used in common schools, to read
tbe grammar alone byitself, is tedicus for the master, hard sor .
the scholar, cold and uncomfortable for them both.
