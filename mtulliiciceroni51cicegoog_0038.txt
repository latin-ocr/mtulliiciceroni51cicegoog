itis able to furnisb him fully, for all points oi grammar, with the
right placing, ordering, and use of words, in all kind of matter.
and why nott For it is read, that Dion Prussaeus, that wise
philosopher, and excellentoratourol all his time, did come tothe
great learning and utterance that was in him, by reading, and
following only two books, Phaedon Platonis, and Demosthenes'
nort notable oration περὶ παραπρεσβείας.

“ And a better and nearer example herein may be, our most
noble Queen Elisabeth, who never took yet Greek nor Latin
gmmmar iu ber hand, after the first declining of a noun and a
rerb3 but only by this double translating of Demosthenes and
leocrates, daily, without missing, every forenoon, and likewise
some part oi Tully every astemoon, sor the space ol a year or
two, bath attained to such a perfect understanding in both the
tongues, and to such a ready utternnce oi the Latin, and that
with such a judgment, as they be few in number in both the
Universities, or elsewhere in England, that be in both tongues
compnrnble with her Majesty ⁴. And to conclude in a short
room the commodities oi double translation; surely the mind by
daily marking, first, the cause and matter; then, the words and
phrases, next the order and composition3 after, the reason and
arguments, then, the forms and figures oi both the tongues3
lastly, the measure and compasr of every sentence, must needs,
by little and little, draw unto it the like shape of eloquence, as
tbe author doth use, which is read. And thus much ior double
translation.”

The parts of Cicero which this volume contains have been
selected for the purpose either of using them alter Ascham‘s
uethod, or merely for reading in the usual way, if a teacber
prefers it. The text of Orelli has generally been followed, but
Orelli has not given all the various readings which an editor
would require, if his object were to establish the text according
to his own judgment, The punctuation of Latin books is diffi-
onlt, and it is impossible to lay down any general rules. The
lanlt oi the common punctuation is theton author is overloaded

⁴To this effect is the testimony of Henry sarilo in his well written
hun oration prononnced tason Elisabeth at Oxford in 1592. His langnage
ispanegyricsl, bnt not extravagant3 and his evidence to tho uumn'nlss'd'xty
numi and Latin is most preciso.
