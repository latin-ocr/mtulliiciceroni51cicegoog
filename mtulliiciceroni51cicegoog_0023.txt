with ‘fragmen' and other like words, shows thet ‘teg' is tlre
first element; which again appears in ‘toga' ‘tectum,' ‘tector,¹
and other words. This mode oi examining the forms of a lan-
guage is now made part of the education of boys in most
schools where Latin is taught well. lt is one of the great aids
towards lsying a sound knowledge of the form and meaning
of words, and consequently it is essential towards a “right
choice of words.'' The system of crude forms is fully explained
in Professor Key's excellent Latin Grammar.

The explaining ol the short sentences to the boys may be oom-
menced as soon as they know the forms of the nouns and the
verb ‘to be;’ for numerous sentences may be found in Latin
authors, which consist of nothing morethan the subject, the
verb ‘to be,' and a predicate. The boy may heled on tosimplc
sentences containing theverbs of predication, so soon as he has
learned the sour conjugations; and he may thus be learning
something of the structure of a sentence at the same time that
he is learning his grammar. This method diminislres the tedium
¹of elementary instruction, while it lays in a good stock of words
and of the simple forms of expression3 and combined with the

Α exercise of reducing words to their crude forms and roots, and
comparing words in which the same root occurs, will furnish
some employment for the faculties beyond the exercise of the
memorv.

As to any other kind of exercises than, this here mentioned,
there is little to recommend them; and many of these exercises
will do a boy much mischier1. What has the boy to leam

a Latin authori All that he thus learns isapart of the lan-
guage, a small part it is true; hut still apsrt of the languege;
and he learns it without any admixture of error. There is a
truth little observed and less practised, which Aschem reminds
