converse a man may certainly learn to speak fluently and ill, as
many do‘. A boy also by writing exercises may learn to write
Ladn with some iacillty, and ill 3 forense in doing a thing, well
or ill, requires practicea Now the “making of Letiues ’' which
leads to such a result is one of the ill consequences cf tecching,
oi which Ascham complains in his day; and the same complaiut
may be made now. Budaeus lamented the ill consequences ol
the use of speaking Latin unadvisedly; and we may complaiu
of the ill consequences of writing it unadvisedly; for the bad
choice os words and the bad order of a boy’s early exercises
make a deeper impression thau the corrections of the master,
even it we suppose the exercises to be always corrected as they
ought to be: and to suppose this would be very extravagant
indeed.

There may be several methods of exercises iu modern lon·
gunges, by which a boy may learn to write correctly; but iu
principle good exercises cannot differ much. A method which
hasbeen tn'ed with success, and is founded on a clear principle,
is shown in the lete Mr. wittiehfe German Exercises, aud his
German Tales. The exercises begin with principal sentences,
cr simple propositione, anoun, the verb ‘to be,' and an adjective
cr other predicate. The most necessary words are supplied at
the foot of the page. All the forms of simple sentences in the
German language are successively presented in the exercises, and
by writing these exercises, in which scarcely any error can be
made, the learner masters one pert and the easiest pert of the
language, but yet the most important, as being the foundation
of all his future knowledge. He then proceeds tc the exercises
iu which subordinate or dependent sentences occur, and when
hebes written all these, and also the second partos the exer-
cises, he has gone through nearly every form of expression which
exists in the language. While he is writing the exercises, he
may read the German tales, which are constructed ou the same
principle as the exercises. A learner who has gone through the
