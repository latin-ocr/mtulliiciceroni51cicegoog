Ι “Yet all men coret to bave their children apeak Latin, and so
do Ι very earnestly too. We both have one purpose, we agree
indesire, we wish one end3 but we differ sornewhat in order,
and way, that leadetb rightly to that end.'’

This passage is from the First Book of “The Schoolmaster;
or, a plain and perfect Way of teaching Children to understand,
write, and speak the Latin Tongue, by Roger Ascham, Esquire,
Preceptor to her Majesty Queen Elisabeth. Now corrected and
reris’d, with an addition of explanatory Notas, by the Reverend
Mr. James Upton‚ AM, Rector of Brimpton, in Somersetshire;
and late fellow of King¹s College, Cambridge.’' (Londou, 1711.)

'l'his passage from Ascham and another which follows have
been printed because the book is not very well known, and
it seemed best tolet Ascham explain his method in his own
language. The parts which 1 bave printed are sufficient to
show what his methodis.

It would be thought a great thingif a teacher could accom-
plish what Ascham promises3 and what, according to his own
account, he performed. At present, it cannot be said that chil-
dren generally do learn either to understand or write the Latin
tongue, much less to speak it. The writing and speaking of
Latin are indeed not much used, but a great deal of time is
spent over trying to understand tbe Latin tongue and also to
write it; and it is generally agreed that few out of many learn
to read a Latin author with ease and profit, and fewer still, to
write Latin well. To read the Latin authors with profit, itis
necessary to know the language, and to understand the matter.
The language may be learned by boys to a certain extent,
though the perfect knowledge of any language requires tha
study of mature years. While a boy is learning the Latin lan-
guage, he may learn something ο1 the matter which his author
treats of. In reading Caesar’s Commentaries he will learn

something of the geography of Gaul, Italy, and Britain, some-
thing of Roman history and Roman institutions; and in reading
Cicero's Letters and Oratione he will learn something more ο1

Roman matters, though there will be many things which be will
not comprehensi fully, until he is ol fiper years. btisphalm
