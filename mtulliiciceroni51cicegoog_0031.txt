xxiv PREFAGE.

Ellis' ingenious plan, he must acquire lor the pleasure of after-
wards getting rid ol it. Ι reject altogether the notion of teach-
ing a hoy any Latin independent os the book that heis study-
ing. instead of mastering his author fully and completely, he
is busy about the making of ‘Latinas ;’ and the more he makes,
in the worse plight he is; while the author from whom he ought
ιο leam the language‚ and whom he should master so as never
to forget, occupies less of his time than lris own bad Latin.
The clear, direct way to an improvement in our classical studies
is to abendon the ordinary making ol ‘Latines3' to adopt
Ascham’s plan as soon as the boy is prepared for it, and to con-
sider well how he should be so prepared3 for that is really the
only matter in dispute among good teachers. Further, to aban-
don all books of exercises which abound in multitudinous rules
arrd fragmentary exercises; to choose as a book of rules ιο refer
a boy to (for Ι do not reject generalizations, but only the mode
oi using them), one which is plain and simple, with plenty of
good examples well translated, whether such book be a gram·
mar, or some well arranged system of rules with both examples
and exercises; and aa to the endless niceties aud curiosities of a
language, to trust to careful reading and a good teacher, for
they cannot be learned by rules. If I recommend Ascham's
metlrod, it is not that boys may learn to write Latiu3 it is that
they may learrr to read it and understand aLatin author well.
But at the same time, I shall observe, by way of meeting the
objectiones those who are so mightily concemed about young
boys learning to write Latin, sslf tire thing were possible, that
Ι expect a pupil, who has been trained in the way which 1 sug·
gest, and has been saved from the exercite system, though he is
not professing to learn to write Latin, to write it better than the
boy who has been learning to write bad Latin: and il a pupil
so, trained, as it is here recomrneuded, clrooses to use his own
diligence, when he has attained proper years, he shall with
reasonable paine write Latin with ease, as well as it carr be
written now-adays. For I maintain that the writing of Latin
well, is that is the object proposed, can only be attained by a
student who has already made considerable progress in the lan-
guage, and has reached to years ol understanding; aud that the
exercitae system generally, so lar irom prepar'mg lim to write
