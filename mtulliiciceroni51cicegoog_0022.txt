ronna and propositione shall be exemplified3 and ii the boy is
drus made familiar with their use by the examples of the best
authors, he will have conquered one of the chief difficulties oi
the language. A boy who has thus got a pretty good stoclr of
words, a knowledge of the structure oi simple sentences, and oi
the use of the pronouns and prepositions, is ready to proceed
upon Asabam's method. It seems a kind of truism to state that
aboy can only learn the Latin language from the Latin authors,
bnt ii the trutb is trite, it is not the less necessary to eniorce it,
for practically it is disregarded. By Latin authors Ι mean not
toraps or datached sentences, but large consecutive places.. lf
aboy could from the first begin, with the teaeber's aid, to read
thatin author, be ought to doit: but this is hardly possible,
aad some preparation oi some kind must be made; about the
nature of which preparation there may be difference oi opinion.

'l'hs examination of the forms of the words of a languags
belongs to that division of grammar, which is called etymology,
sterm which comprehends both the varieties of form which any
given word may undergo, and also the relations of words to
other kindred words. A true etymological examination oi
words leads to a proper classification of them, to a determination
of their* elementary parts or roots; and by a comparison of the
various passages in which they occur, to a determination of their
primary and secondary meanings. An examination of the
sancus forms of nouus also leads to a better arrangement of
their declensions⁹. By reducing each noun to its crude form,
thetis, to the form which it has when deprived of the adjuncta

of case, the learner perceiwes what is the true word and what is
Ι the accident or modifying part: thus ‘lapid' is the true word
lor ‘stone,’ os which ‘lapis,' ‘lapidis' ‘lapidibua’ are the word
with its accidence of case. The same remark applies to verbs:
‘mone’ is the verbal form, which has its tenses, ‘manea’
‘monebam,' ‘monebo' formed by certain additions. The
element or root is generally a monosyllabis, and sometimes must
be tracad back through several forms before it can be dis·
covered: as ‘tegmentorum' leads to the crude form ‘tegmenta'
which again leads to ‘tegmen ;' and a comparison ol ‘ tegrnen’
