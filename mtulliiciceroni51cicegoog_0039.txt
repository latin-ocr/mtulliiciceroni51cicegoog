xxxii PREFAOE.

with stops, and words which are closely connected in sense are
often separated in such a manner that a learner does not see
their connexion. But when a man begins ιο atrike out the
points, he will often find that when he has got rid of one, he
ι must get rid of another, and then a third, so that many short
sentences will remain without any point; which however is no
disadvantage, but the contrary. A short sentence seldom re-
* quires any points. In the longer sentences it is necessary to
place some points to mark the chief pauses, which would be
made in reading them; but they need not be many. It may be
objected ιο the punctuation of this book, that it is not always
consistent; but I have preferred occasional inconsistency, or
apparent inconsistency, to the usual system of punctuation,
which itself has not even the merit of consistency. Whatever
fault may be found with the punctuation of this book, a diligent
boy will understand Cicero better, as I have, pointed the text,
than if he reads it in the point-belaboured editions which are
commonly used. He will not fail in many cases to see the rela-
tion of words ιο one another which in the ordinary texts is dis·
jointed by perplexing points.
The notes are mainly intended to explain the language. I
have attempted to explain the meaning of a few single words,
which are either difficult or sometimes misunderstoo'd; tha
right placing of some words, which it is important ιο observe;
and the usage of those words, which chiefly serve to connect
the subordinate or dependent with the principal sentences. 1
have not attempted ιο give reasons for certain forms of ex-
pression, for such reasons are generally very insufficient3 hut
Ihave attempted to show the logical structure of the sentence.
Those who have not been used to a critical study of Latin, may
perhaps be led to see how far a careful study and comparison of
'a small portion of one author, and that the best in the Latin lan-
guage, will enable a student to master all the ordinary forms of
expression and to construet a sentence with accuracy. A person
will scarcely believe till he has tried the experiment‚ how much
of the language is contained in a single treatise, such as the De
Senectute. This small treatise alone, ifthoroughly mastered
on Ascham’s plan, would make a man a good Latin scholar.
