68 LAELIUS.

Roman notions 01 virtue, and connected with the Roman
ideal 01 0 State, he has handled the matter well, and in
an instructive manner. He who would now treat of it
from a different point 01 view, and in a more compre·
bensive manner, might still derivo something from the
Roman original, as Jercmy Raylor has done in his dis-
course of the Messores and Offices cf Rriendship. But
it is difficolt to discuss the nature of friendsbip, for itis
an indeterminate relation. It is a name whichis much
used and to which certain notione are loosely attached.
As we must live in society, and as circumstances, without
our own choice, bring us nearer to some than tc others,
we contract intimocies, to which we often give the name
01 friendships. If these friendships do not come up tc the
ideal 01 the Roman, 01 which, as he says, all history gives
us onlya few examples, yet these intimacies are various
degrees towards this perfect union, and cicero’s remarks
on friendship arc practically useful.

It is a kind 01 fashion 10 print the Oato Major and the ·
Laehus together. They are both practical trectises, and
they have a general resemblance inform. But old ageis '
a much simpler thing 10 handle than friendship3 and
those who will carefully read the two treatises, will 1001
’ that Oicero found it so. The whole argument cf the ,
Laelius, and the connexion 01 the several parts, are much
more difficult 10 apprehend3 many passages have been
misunderstood, and the interpretation of several parts is
. still doubtful. The teacher who will undertake to read
the Laehus with a class will find plenty to do, if his expo-
sition is 10 be 01 any use to the pupils 3 for, besides the

difficulty in the argument, the matter generally is of a
kind that requires a very particular explanation3 much
more than the plain blunt discourse 01 Cato. This trea-
