'reunion m

Latin, is a direct obstacle to the acquisition of this power. But
let us return to‘Ascham. '

The following passage is from the second book of the School-
master:

“After that your scholar, as 1 said before, shall come indeed,
hrst to a ready perfectness in translating, then toa ripe and ¹
skilsul choica in marlring out his six⁵ points; as,

1. Proprium. 4. Contrarium.

2. Translatum. 5. Diversum.

3. synonymum. 6. Phrases.
Theo take this order with him : read daily unto him some book
01⁴ Tully, as the third book of Epistles, chosen out by Sturmius, ,
De Amicitia, De Senectute, or that excellent epistle containing
almost the whole first book Ad Q. Fratrem some comedy of
Terence cr Plautus. But in Plautus skilful choice must be used
hythe master, to train his scholar to a judgment in cutting out
persectly over-old and improper words. Caesar's Commentaries
are to be read with all curiosity, whereiu especially (without all
exception to be made either by friend or foe) is seen the un·
spotted propriety of the Latin tongue, even when it was, as the
Grecians say, in ἀκμῇ, thetis, at the highest pitch of all perfect·
ness; or some orations of T. Livius, such as be both longest and
plainest.
’ “These books I would have him read now a good deal at
every lecture; for he shall not now use daily translation, but
only construe again, and perse, where ye suspect is any need:
yet let him not omit in these books his former exercise, in
marking diligently, and writing orderly out of his six points;
and for translating, use you yourself every second or third day
to chuse out some Epistle ad Atticum, some notable common·
place out os his Oratione, or some other part of Tully by your
discretiori, which your scholar may not know where to find;
and translate it you yourself into plain natural English, and
then give it him to translate into Latin again, allowing him
good space and time to do it both with diligent heed and good
advisement.
