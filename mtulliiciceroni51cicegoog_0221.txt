178 CICERONIS EPISTOLARUM LIBRI DUO.

salue, are worth reading aa specimcns of the excellent
practica] knowledge of Latin which most of the writers
had uhe letters of J ewell are almost faultless, and vary
lively and amusing.

The only difficulties in these letters of Cicero ariae
either from particular words or from the general matter.
Ihave briefly explained a few of those terms which pusulo
alearner, or even a teacher who has not turned his
attention particularly to the letters of Cicero and to the Ι
technioul terme which hequently occur in them. Asto
the matter, I hove done enough to show what the letters
are about, when such information was necessary ; and by ’
puttIng those to the same person together, Ihave some·
what diminished a difficulty which ia inherent in all
epistolary correspondence. Though the letters were se
lected solely for the language, I have chosen such as help
to explain one another3 and a reader will find that, when ·
he has got through a few, he will have lese trouble with
the rest. I have taken many of those to Τίτῳ and indeed '
the whole book of letters to Tiro might have been well -
placed here. They are of the familiar affectionate kind,
turn upon a few matters, of which Tiro¹s poor health is
one; and they show the amiable side of the family of the
Ciceros in their attachment to afaithful servant. Setting
asido the difficulty of the matter, which in these lettersis
not great, there is no Latin author read in schools‚ either
good or bad, whose language is easier for sboy than the
language of these letters.

Ihave given the dates A. u, o. of the letters as they ara
given in Orelli's edition3 hut a few of the dates are not
certain. I have used the notes of P. Manutius and those
in the Verior-um edition; and some of those iu Siiplle's
collection, for I happened to select several letters that
he has selected, and heiore I saw his hook.
